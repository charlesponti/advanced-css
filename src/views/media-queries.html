<h1 class="text-center"> Media Queries </h1>

<pre>
    <code class="language-css" prism>
        @media screen and (max-width: 768px) {
            background-color: yellow;
        }
    </code>
</pre>

    We need to utilize Media Queries to deploy adjustments to our layouts as and when they’re needed.

    We know breakpoints should be placed not at predetermined widths, but rather at the point at which the design “breaks” and warrants adjustment.
