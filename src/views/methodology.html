<h1 class="text-center"> Methodology </h1>

<p>
    There are countless different CSS methodologies poking around today, from
    SMACSS to BEM to WHOZAMAWHATSIT. The particular methodology that you prescribe
    to is not important. In fact, you do not have to prescribe to any preexisting
    methodology and make your own if you choose. No matter which of these options
    you choose, there are a few key factors that must be taken into account in
    order to write great CSS.

<h2 class="text-center"> Keys </h2>
<ul class="list-group">
    <li class="list-group-item">
        <h3>Understandable</h3>
        <p>
            This key is a rather obvious one. Whichever methodology that you
            choose, it must be understandable both by the experienced members of
            your team and the layman. If a non-developer could read your class
            names and gather what they mean, then you have succeeded in
            achieving this goal.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        <h3>Flexible</h3>
        <p>
            Your methodology should be flexible. Many methodologies are very
            strict in their execution. This can be great in helping developers
            not go to far off the path when making new classes and writing new
            CSS rules. This can also not be so great because, on any non-trivial
            web site, flexibility is required. You and your team will no doubt
            find yourselves in a position at some point where you will need to
            style a component inside of a component inside of a component inside
            of a component... and will find it very difficult to apply the rules
            of the methodology you've decided to follow to the situation you are
            in. This is where you will need flexibility in your methodology.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        <h3>Functional & Modular</h3>
        <p>
            Classes and the grouping of CSS rules should be done on the basis
            of their functionality and not on their content. The reason for
            this is, if you create rules based on content, you will find it
            difficult of reuse classes if you base their grouping on the
            content that you are trying to style at that moment. If you
            create classes to be based on their functionality, such as
            positioning or applying designated widths, those classes will be
            much more modular adn reusable in the future.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
        <h3>Consistent</h3>
        <p>
            This is the only key that can feel a bit strict, but it is
            important if the methodology you take on or create is to be
            understandable. Your approach should be consistent. Members of
            the team, both new and old, should be able to make assumptions
            about the code they're reading and the code they're writing
            because they know that everyone on the team has been consistent
            with the approach taken. This does not mean that rules cannot be
            broken. There will no doubt be times when rules will have to be
            either bent or broken in order to accomplish the task at hand. If
            a consistent rule is to be bent of broken, however, it is important
            to write comments within the code about why this was done so that
            other developers who stuble upon it later on will understand. You
            can also leave a TODO in the comments if this violation can be
            fixed in the future through some form of code refactoring.
